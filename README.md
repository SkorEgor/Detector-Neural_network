# Detector: Neural Network

Find spectral lines in recorded data with the help of a neural network.

## Requirements:
 * Python >= 3.10,
 * `joblib`,
 * `numpy`,
 * `pandas`,
 * `pyqtgraph`,
 * `scipy`,
 * `scikit-learn`,
 * `PyQt5`, `PyQt6`, or `PySide6-Essentials`.

If you have several Qt bindings installed,
one of them will be used automatically.
If you'd like to have a specific flavor to use,
provide its name in the `PYQTGRAPH_QT_LIB` environment variable (case-sensitive!).
